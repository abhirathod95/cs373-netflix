    Fixes #20; Fixed the tests to display the RMSE from the optimized solution instead of the simple solution. Changed makefile to run pydoc and create the netflix.log, so fixes #8 and fixes #9 but they'll be updated later as we finish up the assignments

    Fixes #18; Fixes #19; Had to change the string format to do 1 decimal places not 2 (the evilness of copying and pasting). Also had to change the solver to write to w and not just print rmse. That's why the test cases weren't passing

    Added in a try except to make sure that all customer ids being checked are in the cache (and thus part of probe.txt). Just in case.

    Changed function definition for read so that it returns a flag that tells us if it was a movie id or customer id. Useful for unit testing and less global variables

    Changed function definition for print so that it doesn't use the global movie flag automatically, but is passed in from solver. Allows for easier unit testing, and doesn't really impact the code flow much
